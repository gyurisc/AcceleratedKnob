AcceleratedKnob
===============

AcceleratedKnob is an anisotropic image generator  for Windows Phone 7. It mimics the [metallic knob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9X7D87uJ7Q) that was found in iOS6.  

The idea and implementation came from danielamitay's  [DAAnisotropicImage](https://github.com/danielamitay/DAAnisotropicImage) project on github. I just wanted to see if similar control can be built for Windows Phone 7.
