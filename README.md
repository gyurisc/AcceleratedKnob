##AcceleratedKnob

AcceleratedKnob is an anisotropic image generator for Windows Phone 7. It mimics the [metallic knob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9X7D87uJ7Q) that is part of the iOS6 music app.  

The idea, the images and the logic came from danielamitay's [DAAnisotropicImage](https://github.com/danielamitay/DAAnisotropicImage) project on github. 

A minor disclaimer is due here. I am not sure, if mimicing such control like this is a good idea or fits the Metro design language. I just wanted to see if similar control can be built for Windows Phone 7.

##Installation 

Just get the following files in your project: 

 - AcceleratedKnob.xaml
 - AcceleratedKnob.xaml.cs
 - AcceleratedSliderControl.xaml
 - AcceleratedSliderControl.xaml.cs
 
Also make sure that you reference the Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll from the lib folder of this project. After this you are ready to go!
